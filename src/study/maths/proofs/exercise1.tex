\begin{problem}
  Read \emph{The Secret of Raising Smart Kids} by Carol Dweck and write a few paragraphs about what you learned and how it may help you be successful in proof-based math class.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
Not Interested.

\begin{problem}
  Explain the error in the following "proof" that $2 = 1$. \\
  Let $x = y$. Then,

\begin{align}
x^2 &= xy \\
x^2 - y^2 &= xy - y^2 \\
(x+y)(x-y) &= y(x-y) \\
x+y &= y \\
2y &= y \\
2 &= 1
\end{align}
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  Since $x = y$, $x-y = 0$ and therefore, we cannot divided by $x-y$ in step $3$ to get $x+y = y$ from $(x+y)(x-y) = y(x-y)$. Thus, solved.
\end{solution}


\begin{problem}
  Suppose that $m$ and $n$ are positive odd integers. Using $2 \times 1$ dominos,

  (a) Does there exist a perfect cover of the $m \times n$ chessboard?

  (b) If I remove 1 square from the $m \times n$ chessboard, will it have a perfect cover?
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}[a]
  In this case, there are $m \times n$ cells on the board which is an odd number. Since each domino covers only $2$ cells, the total number of cells covered will always be even.

  Hence, no perfect cover exists.
\end{solution}

\begin{scratch}[b]
  Let us take $3 \times 3$ chessboard. There are $9$ cells on the board. Without loss of generality, let us say there are $4$ white cells and $5$ black cells.

  Since a domino always covers $1$ white and $1$ black cell, the number of white and black cell must be equal for a perfect cover.

  Let us remove a black cell from the above chessboard. Now there are $4$ white cells and $4$ black cells.

  Checking all $5$ black squares for removal, we find that we have a cover in every case.
\end{scratch}

\begin{solution}[b]
  Let us assume that the board has $x$ white cells and $x+1$ black cells.
	Note: If it is not the case, we can always swap the colors and have the same setup.

	Since each domino must cover exactly $1$ white and $1$ black cell, we must remove a black cell to have a perfect cover.

	In this scenario, all the corners will have black cells since there are more black cells than white.

	Now, the question is, whether we can remove any black cell. 

	\begin{lemma}\label{even_chessboard}
		For every chessboard of size $m \times n$, there exists a cover if either $m$ or $n$ is even.
	\end{lemma}

	\begin{proof}
		Let us assume that $m$ is even. We can always turn the board if $n$ is even.

		For every column, we have an even number of cells in that column as $m$ is even. Hence, we can cover that column with dominos.

		Hence, proved.
	\end{proof}


	Let us say we removed a black cell from row $r$. Now, there are two cases:
	\bigbreak

	\underline{Case 1.} $r$ is odd.

	In this case, we can divide the remaining chessboard into $(r-1) \times n$ and $(m-r) \times n$ and cover them by Lemma \ref{even_chessboard}.
	
	\textbf{Note}: In case $r = 1$ or $r = m$, we only have one remaining part. The second part is empty and thus, requires no cover.
	
	Since the corners are black, the left most cell of every odd row must be black because the colors are alternating. That is, all the cells in first column and rows $1, 3, 5, ..., m$ must be black.

	Since $r$ is odd, the left most cell in it must be black.
	Thus, the columns containing black cells in row $r$ are odd, i.e., cells in columns $1, 3, 5, ..., n$ and row $r$ are black.

	Thus, if we remove any black cell from row $r$
	we will have divided the row into two even sized pieces, 
	which can be covered by the dominos by Lemma \ref{even_chessboard}.

	\bigbreak
	\underline{Case 2.} $r$ is even.

	In this case, we can take rows $r-1, r, r+1$ 
	and divide the remaining chess board in $(r-2) \times n$ and $(m-r-1) \times n$ 
	and cover them by Lemma \ref{even_chessboard}.

	Since $r$ is even, all the cells in row $r$ and columns $2, 4, 8, ..., n-1$ are black.
	
	Let us say we remove the cell in column $c$. Now, we can take column $c-1, c$ and $c+1$, 
	and divide the rest of cells into chess boards of sizes $(c-2)\times 3$ and $(n-c-1) \times 3$. Since $c$ is even, therefore, $c-2$ and $n-c-1$ are even as well.
	
	Thus, we can cover these boards using Lemma \ref{even_chessboard}.

	Now, for the remainig $3 \times 3$ board without its center, we can cover it like this:
	\bigbreak

	\begin{tikzpicture}
		\foreach \x in {0,1,2}
		\foreach \y in {0,1,2}
		{
			\draw (\x,\y) -- (\x+1,\y) -- (\x+1,\y+1) -- (\x,\y+1) -- (\x,\y);
		}

		\draw (1,1) -- (2,2) -- (1,2) -- (2,1);

		\draw (0.1,0.1) -- (1.9,0.1) -- (1.9,0.9) -- (0.1,0.9) -- (0.1,0.1);
		\draw (2.1,0.1) -- (2.9,0.1) -- (2.9, 1.9) -- (2.1,1.9) -- (2.1,0.1);
		\draw (2.9,2.1) -- (2.9,2.9) -- (1.1,2.9) -- (1.1,2.1) -- (2.9,2.1);
		\draw (0.1,1.1) -- (0.9,1.1) -- (0.9,2.9) -- (0.1,2.9) -- (0.1,1.1);
	\end{tikzpicture}

		Hence, proved.

\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
  The game \textbf{Tetris} is played with five different shapes -- the five shapes that can be obtained by piecing together four squares.

\bigbreak

\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\draw[thick] (0,0) -- (1,0) -- (1,4) -- (0,4) -- (0,0);
	\draw (0,1) -- (1,1);
	\draw (0,2) -- (1,2);
	\draw (0,3) -- (1,3);

	\draw[thick] (2,0) -- (4,0) -- (4,2) -- (2,2) -- (2,0);
	\draw (3,0) -- (3,2);
	\draw (2,1) -- (4,1);

	\draw[thick] (5,0) -- (8,0) -- (8,1) -- (7,1) -- (7,2) -- (6,2) -- (6,1) -- (5,1) -- (5,0);
	\draw (6,0) -- (6,1) -- (7,1) -- (7,0);

	\draw[thick] (9,0) -- (11,0) -- (11,1) -- (12,1) -- (12,2) -- (10,2) -- (10,1) -- (9,1) -- (9,0);
	\draw (10,0) -- (10,1) -- (11,1) -- (11,2);

	\draw[thick] (13,0) -- (13,3) -- (14,3) -- (14,1) -- (15,1) -- (15,0) -- (13,0);
	\draw (13,1) -- (14,1) -- (14,0);
	\draw (13,2) -- (14,2);
\end{tikzpicture}
}
\bigbreak

	For the questions below, we also allow these pieces to be "flipped over".

	(a) Is it possible to perfectly cover a $4 \times 5$ chessboard using each of these shapes exactly once? Prove that it is impossible, or show by example that it is possible.

	(b) Is it possible to perfectly cover an $8 \times 5$ chessboard using each of these shapes exactly twice? Prove that it is impossible, or show by example that it is possible.
\end{problem}

\begin{scratch}
	Let's color the chessboard in black and white. Here, we can see that all the shapes will cover $2$ black cells and $2$ white cells except the third shape.

	The third shape will cover either $3$ black and $1$ white cell or $1$ black and $3$ white cells.

	Therefore, if we use each shape exactly once, we will get either get a total of $11$ black and $9$ white cells or $9$ black and $11$ white cells.
\end{scratch}

\begin{solution}[a]
	Let's assume that it is possible to cover a $4 \times 5$ chessboard using these shapes exactly once.

	The chess board has exactly $10$ black and $10$ white cells in it. Each shape will take up exactly $2$ white and $2$ black cells except the third shape. 

	The third shape will either take up $3$ black and $1$ white cell or $3$ white or $1$ black cell. This is because all adjacent cells must be different color so if the center of the third shape is white, all the rest $3$ cells of that shape must be black and vice versa.

	Let's place each shape one by one. \\
	After placing the first shape, we will have $8$ black and $8$ white cells. \\
	After placing the second shape, we will have $6$ black and $6$ white cells. \\
	After placing the fourth shape, we will have $4$ black and $4$ white cells. \\
	After placing the fifth shape, we will have $2$ black and $2$ white cells.

	Now, we don't have enough white or black cells to place the third shape.
	This is a contradiction. Therefore, it is impossible to cover a $4 \times 5$ chessboard using each of these shapes exactly once.

	Hence, proved.
