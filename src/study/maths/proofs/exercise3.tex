\begin{problem}
	Suppose $A$ and $B$ are two boxes. Describe the following in terms of boxes: $A \\ B$, $\mathcal{P}(A)$ and $|A|$.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
	$A \\ B$: This is a box with all the objects in $A$ that are not in $B$.

	$\mathcal{P}(A)$: This is a box with many boxes such that each box in this box has objects from $A$.

	$|A|$: Number of objects in $A$.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
	The set $\{5a+3b: a, b \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ is equal to a familiar set. By examining which elements are possible, determine the familiar set.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
	For $a = b = 0$, we get $5a + 3b = 0$. \\
	For $a = -1$ and $b = 2$, we get $5a + 3b = -5+6 = 1$.

	Since we have $0$ and $1$, we can build any integers $k$ by setting $a = -1 \cdot k$ and $b = 2 \cdot k$ which gives us $-5k+6k = k$.

	Thus, our set is the set of integers, $\mathbb{Z}$.

	It is trivial that all elements of the given set are integers to the given set is a subset of integers.

	Now, for any $x \in \mathbb{Z}$, we can take $a = -x$ and $b = 2x$ since $-x, 2x \in \mathbb{Z}$ and get $5a + 3b = -5x + 6x = x$ which is an element of the given set.
	Thus, $\mathbb{Z}$ is a subset of the given set.

	Therefore, both sets are equal.

\begin{problem}
	Suppose $A, B$ and $C$ are sets. Is there a difference between $(A \times B) \times C$ and $A \times (B \times C)$? Explain your answer.
